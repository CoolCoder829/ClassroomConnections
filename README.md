# ClassroomConnections
An app that contains an anonymous classroom chat with unique features that fosters the authentic personal connection found in a classroom and acts as a means of efficient communication between student and teacher.

The only way you are going to be able to run our code is through downloading xcode and following the steps below. If not then watch the demo video, it explains every feature. I asked one of the organizers in the video call and he notified us that our demo video is fine for submission even if you can't run. You can check the code to make sure our project is not faked.


Instructions for Use:
1. install file
2. open terminal
3. cd into the directory that the project is stored: ex. cd downloads cd classroomconnections
4. enter: "sudo gem install cocoapods" in terminal
5. enter: "pod install" in terminal
6. open project and run code
7. Simulator should pop up and just follow the demo video walkthrough


The bulk of the code is stored in the classroom connections folder, view controllers. There you can find most of our ui implementations and backend.
